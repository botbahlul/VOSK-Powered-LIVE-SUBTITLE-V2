# VOSK-Powered-LIVE-SUBTITLE-V2
ANDROID APP that can RECOGNIZE ANY LIVE AUDIO/VIDEO STREAMING (using free VOSK Speech Recognition API) then TRANSLATE (using MLKIT TranslateE API) and display them as SUBTITLES with a MANAGEABLE STORAGE SPACE USED BY VOSK MODELS (you can dynamically DOWNLOAD and DELETE VOSK models in phone storage to save space)

This version is modified version of https://github.com/botbahlul/VOSK-Powered-LIVE-SUBTITLE

I suggest to use Variant 3 at https://github.com/botbahlul/VOSK-Powered-Live-Subtitle-V3 because in my opinion it has better results.
